# Company Finance Intelligence Dashboard (1-Year Analysis)

An executive-ready **Finance Analytics Dashboard** built to monitor **financial health, cash flow, cost control, budget performance, and risk signals** across a company’s operations over a one-year period.

This project simulates the kind of **decision-support dashboards used by CFOs, FP&A teams, and finance leaders** to track performance, manage risk, and improve profitability.

## Project Overview

This dashboard answers real business questions such as:

- Is the company financially healthy?
- Are expenses growing faster than revenue?
- Which cost categories and vendors drive the most spend?
- Are we meeting revenue, expense, and profit targets?
- Are there early warning signs of financial risk?

The goal is not just visualization — but **actionable financial insight**.

## Data Structure

- **transactions** – Daily income & expense transactions with running balance

- **monthly_targets** – Revenue, expense, and profit targets
- **merchant_rules** – Recurring vendors and risk flags

This mirrors how finance data is commonly modeled in real organizations.
